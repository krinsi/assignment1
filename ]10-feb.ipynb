    "    The built-in function open() is used to open a file in Python.\n",
    "   \n",
    "------The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (read-only mode): opens the file for reading. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode in which a file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode): opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its content is truncated (deleted). If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode): opens the file for writing and appends the new data to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode): creates a new file for writing, but fails if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (binary mode): opens the file in binary mode. This is used for non-text files like images, audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"t\" (text mode): opens the file in text mode. This is the default mode for text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modes can be combined, so for example, \"rb\" means \"open the file in binary mode for reading\". The most common modes are \"r\" and \"w\"."

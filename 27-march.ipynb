    "    R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a measure of how well the linear regression model fits the data.\n",

    "   Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. While R-squared measures the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s), adjusted R-squared penalizes for the addition of irrelevant variables in the model.\n",

    "Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "   It is generally more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables, as it takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and penalizes for adding irrelevant variables. This helps to avoid overfitting the model by including unnecessary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two models with different numbers of independent variables: Model A with two independent variables and Model B with four independent variables. If the regular R-squared for both models is similar, we may be tempted to choose Model B because it has more independent variables. However, if we calculate the adjusted R-squared, we may find that Model A has a higher adjusted R-squared value, indicating that it is a better fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared can also be useful when performing stepwise regression, which involves adding or removing variables from the model to find the best fit. In this case, using adjusted R-squared helps to select the model that includes only the relevant variables, while penalizing for the addition of irrelevant variables.\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term is based on the absolute values of the regression coefficients and is designed to encourage the model to select a smaller set of important features.\n",

    "Lasso regularization differs from Ridge regularization, also known as L2 regularization, in that the penalty term is based on the square of the regression coefficients. This has the effect of shrinking all of the coefficients towards zero, rather than setting some coefficients exactly to zero as Lasso regularization does. This means that Ridge regularization tends to produce models with more evenly distributed coefficient values, whereas Lasso regularization can lead to sparse models with many coefficients set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Lasso regularization is more appropriate to use when the dataset has a large number of features and only a small subset of them are likely to be important for predicting the outcome variable. This is because Lasso regularization tends to perform feature selection automatically, whereas Ridge regularization does not. However, if all of the features are believed to be important, or if the goal is simply to improve the model's generalization performance, then Ridge regularization may be more appropriate.\n",

    "Another difference between the two regularization techniques is that Lasso regularization may produce unstable coefficient estimates when there are highly correlated predictor variables (i.e. multicollinearity) in the dataset. In contrast, Ridge regularization can handle multicollinearity well and produce more stable coefficient estimates.\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "   Regularized linear models, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, help to prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the loss function that shrinks the magnitude of the regression coefficients towards zero. This penalty term is designed to discourage the model from relying too heavily on any one predictor variable, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example where we want to predict housing prices based on several predictor variables, including the square footage of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the distance to the nearest school. We have a dataset of 100 houses with known prices and predictor values, and we want to train a linear regression model to predict the price of a new house based on its predictor values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without regularization, our linear regression model might produce a high degree of overfitting if we have many predictor variables, particularly if some of those variables are highly correlated. This could result in a model that fits the training data very well but performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "However, if we add Lasso or Ridge regularization to our linear regression model, we can constrain the magnitude of the regression coefficients and reduce the risk of overfitting. The regularization parameter controls the strength of the penalty term and allows us to find a balance between fitting the training data well and generalizing to new data.\n",

This can help to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

If the true relationship between these variables is highly non-linear, a regularized linear model may not be able to capture this complexity effectively.\n",

    "Another limitation is that regularized linear models require careful selection of the regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty term.
